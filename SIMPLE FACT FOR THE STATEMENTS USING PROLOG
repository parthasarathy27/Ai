AIM:
 To write simple fact for the statements using prolog.

ALGORITHM:
 Step1: In Prolog syntax, we can write −
 Understand logical programming
 syntax and semantics. Design
 programs in PROLOG language.
 Step2: Prolog programs describe relations, defined by means of clauses. Pure
 prolog is restricted to horn clauses. There are two types of clauses:
 facts and rules. A rule is one of the form Head:-Body.
 and is read as “Head is true if Body is true”.
 Step3: A rule's body consists of calls to predicates, which are called the rule's goals.
 a. Ram like s mango.
 b. Seema is a girl.
 c. Bill likes Cindy.
 d. Rose is red.
 e. John owns gold.

PROGRAM:
 clauses
 likes(ram,mango).
 girl(seema).
 red(rose).
 likes(bill, cindy).
 owns(john,gold).

OUTPUT:
 Goal queries
 ?- likes(ram,What).
 What=mango
 ?- likes(Who,cindy).
 Who=bill
 ?- red(What).
 What=rose.
 ?- owns(Who,What).
 Who=john What=gold.

RESULT:
 Thus the simple fact for the statements using prolog was created and the output was verified successfully.
