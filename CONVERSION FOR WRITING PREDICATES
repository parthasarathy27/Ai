AIM:
 To write predicates one converts centigrade temperatures to Fahrenheit, the other checks if a temperature is below freezing.

ALGORITHM:
 Step 1: Start the program
 Step 2 : Read the input of temperature in Celsius (say C)
 Step 3 : F=(9*C)/5+32
 Step 4 : Print temperature in fahrenheit is F 
 Step 5 : print the output.
 
PROGRAM:
 Production Rules:
 Arithmetic : c_to_f
 f is c * 9 / 5 + 32
 freezing f < = 32

Rules:
 c_to_f(C,F):-
 F is C * 9 / 5 + 32. 
 freezing(F) :- F =< 32.

OUTPUT:
 ?- c_to_f(100,X).
 X = 212.
 ?- freezing(15).
 true.
 ?- freezing(45).
 false.
 
RESULT:
 Thus the predicates one to converts centigrade temperatures toFahrenheit, the other checks if a temperature is below freezing was created
 and the output was verified successfully.
