----------------------
In prolog, We declare some facts. These facts constitute the Knowledge Base of the system. We can query against the Knowledge Base. We get output as affirmative if our query is already in the knowledge Base or it is implied by Knowledge Base, otherwise we get output as negative. 

# What is Prolog? 
-----------------
Prolog or PROgramming in LOGics is a logical and declarative programming language. It is one major example of the fourth generation language that supports the declarative programming paradigm. This is particularly suitable for programs that involve symbolic or non-numeric computation. This is the main reason to use Prolog as the programming language in Artificial Intelligence, where symbol manipulation and inference manipulation are the fundamental tasks.

In Prolog, we need not mention the way how one problem can be solved, we just need to mention what the problem is, so that Prolog automatically solves it. However, in Prolog we are supposed to give clues as the solution method.

# Some Applications of Prolog

Prolog is used in various domains. It plays a vital role in automation system. 

Following are some other important fields where Prolog is used −

-Intelligent Database Retrieval

-Natural Language Understanding

-Specification Language

-Machine Learning

-Robot Planning

-Automation System

-Problem Solving

## Advantages :
---------------
1. Easy to build database. Doesn’t need a lot of programming effort.
2. Pattern matching is easy. Search is recursion based.
3. It has built in list handling. Makes it easier to play with any algorithm involving lists.

## Disadvantages :
------------------
1. LISP (another logic programming language) dominates over prolog with respect to I/O features.
2. Sometimes input and output is not easy.
