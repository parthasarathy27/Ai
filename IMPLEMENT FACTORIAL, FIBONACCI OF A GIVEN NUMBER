AIM:
To write a program to implement factorial, Fibonacci of a given number.

ALGORITHM:
 Step1: Start
 Step2: Declare variables i,a,b,show
 Step3: Intialize the variables a=0,b=1, and show=0
 Step4: Enter the number of terms of Fibonacci series to be printed
 Step5: Print First two terms of series
 Step6: Use loop for the following steps
 ➢ Show=a+=b
 ➢ a=b
 ➢ b=show
 ➢ increase value of i each time by 1
 ➢ print the value of show
 Step7: End
 
PROGRAM:
RULES: FACTORIAL
factorial(0,1).
factorial(N,F) :-
N>0,
N1 is N-1,
factorial(N1,F1),
F is N * F1.

OUTPUT:
Goal:
?- factorial(4,X).
X=24

RULES: FIBONACCI
fib(0,0).
fib(X,Y) :- X>0,fib(X,Y,_).
fib(1,1,0).
fib(X,Y1,Y2) :-
X>1,
X1 is X-1,
fib(X1,Y2,Y3),
Y1 is Y2+Y3.

OUTPUT:
Goal:
?- fib(10,X).
X=55

RESULT:
Thus the program to implement factorial, Fibonacci of a given number using prolog was executed
and the output was verified successfully.
